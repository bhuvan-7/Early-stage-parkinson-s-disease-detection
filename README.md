# 🧠 Early Stage Parkinson's Disease Detection

Welcome to the Early Stage Parkinson's Disease Detection project! This application leverages deep learning techniques to classify **spiral** and **wavy drawings** as either **Healthy** or indicative of **Parkinson's Disease**. The project includes a trained model, a Flask web interface, and an easy-to-use drag-and-drop feature.

---

## 🌟 Features

- 🎨 **Image Classification**: Predicts whether a drawing is from a healthy individual or someone with Parkinson's Disease.
- ⚡ **Fast and Accurate**: Built using a pre-trained VGG16 model for reliable predictions.
- 🌐 **Web Interface**: User-friendly drag-and-drop upload functionality.
- 📈 **Scalable Design**: Easily extendable to include additional datasets or improve accuracy.
